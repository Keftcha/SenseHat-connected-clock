Colors are stored in ./colors.json
We use json module for store colors instead of pickle
because the user can easily add, remove colors or change colors order.
Colors are use as a dictionary,
the key is the color name and the value is a list representing the RGB values (0 to 255)

For the weather functionality we install the weather-api pip package
https://pypi.org/project/weather-api/
