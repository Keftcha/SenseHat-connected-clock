## Binary clocks

Display a [binary clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_clock "Wikipedia - Binary clock").  
Two modes are available.

### Block mode

Dots are displayed on the matrix using 2 by 2 LED.  
This mode uses all the space of the LED matrix.

---

### Hyphen mode

Dots are displayed on the matrix using 1 LED for the height and 2 for the width.  
This mode only uses a part of the LED matrix.

---

The matrix LED is divided into four parts:

- Top Left (hours tens)

Hours are on the top and minutes on the bottom of the LED matrix
