# Welcome to SenseHat connected clock

This is the official documentation of the SenseHat connecter clock.  
Be pleased to find all the source code on
[Github](https://github.com/Keftcha/SenseHat-connected-clock "SenseHat

##Â Why this project

One day, I see a video about a clock which we can be programmed and display
information on a LED Matrix.  
I loved to get that clock, but when I see the price (which was very expensive) I
I choose to program mine on the sense-hat device of the RaspberryPi.
